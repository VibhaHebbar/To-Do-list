# To-Do-list
A to-do list with JavaScript is an application where users can add, complete, delete, and store tasks. Key features include:

Add Tasks: Users input tasks that appear in the list.
Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked complete with a checkbox, often showing a strike-through.
Delete Tasks: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
Store Tasks: Tasks persist after page reload using localStorage.
HTML structures the list, CSS styles it, and JavaScript handles the functionality, including adding, deleting, and saving tasks. It's a great project for practicing DOM manipulation and event handling.
